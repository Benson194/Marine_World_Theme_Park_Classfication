The Marine World theme park is a major holiday destination in the state that attracts throngs of holiday makers especially during weekends. To help boost business, the park meticulously keeps track of the particulars and spending habits of its customers who joined its customer loyalty programme and visited the park. The collected data helps the park management to better understand the customer preference and improve its service and product offer. The park had opened a new attraction, Merry Go Round (MGR), last month. The new attraction seemed to attract mainly children and woman customers.
